Found one with a HashMap instead of a Vec:

### Loxido

The guty write an entire blog on his experiences:
http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/11/01/after-nll-interprocedural-conflicts/
Basically, he offer two implementations, one based on Vec, one with Unsafe
pointers.

Pointers to https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists, which explains
parts of the problems I am trying to solve.

### internings strings

Straightforwad interpreter combines a Vec with a hashmap, sacrificing some space
for simplicity. Strings become `usize`. No garbage collection as far as I can
tell: this would screw up the data structure. Hypothetically, the same can be
fone for (native) functions, and maybe upvalues.

I seem to have solved the string pool issues somehow. Some testing is necessary
of course.

What do I rreally want to learn? The garbage collector itself is more important
than the details of hash maps ans sets etc. So couldn't that work?

I guess I'd like to replace the linked lists as well, because that is along the
same lines. Idk what that does to garbage collection: just moving all values to
a new vec doesn't sound performant, but maybe it is quicker than running though
a linked list.

IDK, I think I am going to be pretty happy with any performance--my goals is the
big picture and choice of datastructure for best performance is a detail.

### finishing review

- One of the few unsafe ones: https://github.com/Kangaxx-0/rox

- A jit compiler for x64 machines: https://github.com/miDeb/loxjit/tree/main

- Rust Zig comparison: https://zackoverflow.dev/writing/unsafe-rust-vs-zig,
  https://github.com/zackradisic/rust-vs-zig. I think I saw thios on the
  primagen.

So the choice is unsafe versus slow implementations based on Vec. And maybe Zig
would have been a beter choice.

Interesting, here everything is `usize`:
https://github.com/rctcwyvrn/rlox/blob/master/src/value.rs#L228. Is related to
using a vec to keep track of all instances. This is as far as I got today. This
implementation suggests that the garbage collector can be limited to closures
and classes, using rusts memory safety for the rest.

Clox uses a single linked list of everything allocated, and pointers, of course,
instead of indices into an array.

### runtime data model

- bound_method: (instance, closure)
- class: (string, closure{})
- closure: (function, up_value[])
- function: (string?, int, int, chunk)
- instance: (class, value{})
- upvalue: ...value...
- bool,nil,number,string, native_function

Options for the garbage collector:

- all unsafe, with *const or *mut
- admbiltfcliff like, with Rc<> and Weak<>

### Implementing memory

I think everything hinges on this: what does the heap with all the values look
like?

- just working with `&` meant lifetimes all over the place. Maybe there is a
  solution there, but maybe I am walking into a trap here.
- I now rely on box, because it is called heap allocated, but I doubt that will
  be much on an improvement.
- I guess using raw pointers like the C example will be an endless fight with
  the compiler and unsafe code, in which case: why is doing this in rust better?
- I see this SlotMap based interpretation: it replaces pointers with keys into
  this map.
- Could be interesting:
  https://github.com/adambiltcliffe/rlox/blob/main/src/value.rs#L202
- I should just go through the list here, and note any interesting option:

The clox scanner uses pointer into the char array, which can be substracted form
one another to track progress. The tslox one canot accss the pointers, so it
uses indices instead. Rlox has utf8 strings, however, so we cannot decently to
either: a character counter is needed to get correct column numbers, but only
for correct column numbers!

Good reminder: string[..3] is three bytes, not three characters. So... shit?
`self.as_bytes()[usize]` `byte.is_utf8_char_boundary` ~ it is not all terrible.

One more idea: tokenize the bytes, since this is good enough for lox anyway.

Learning rust while regurgitating crafting interpreters.

### the scanner

Some ideas: probabaly best to use the iterator over the chars to create an
iterator of tokens. Do the 4 fields of the struct still make sense? In
typescript it becomes 5, but uses indices, which don't work in rust.
