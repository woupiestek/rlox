Options for the garbage collector:
- all unsafe, with *const or *mut
- admbiltfcliff like, with Rc<> and Weak<>

### Implementing memory

I think everything hinges on this: what does the heap with all the values look
like?

- just working with `&` meant lifetimes all over the place. Maybe there is a
  solution there, but maybe I am walking into a trap here.
- I now rely on box, because it is called heap allocated, but I doubt that will
  be much on an improvement.
- I guess using raw pointers like the C example will be an endless fight with
  the compiler and unsafe code, in which case: why is doing this in rust better?
- I see this SlotMap based interpretation: it replaces pointers with keys into
  this map.
- Could be interesting:

- I should just go through the list here, and note any interesting option:

The clox scanner uses pointer into the char array, which can be substracted form
one another to track progress. The tslox one canot accss the pointers, so it
uses indices instead. Rlox has utf8 strings, however, so we cannot decently to
either: a character counter is needed to get correct column numbers, but only
for correct column numbers!

Good reminder: string[..3] is three bytes, not three characters. So... shit?
`self.as_bytes()[usize]` `byte.is_utf8_char_boundary` ~ it is not all terrible.

One more idea: tokenize the bytes, since this is good enough for lox anyway.

Learning rust while regurgitating crafting interpreters.

### the scanner

Some ideas: probabaly best to use the iterator over the chars to create an
iterator of tokens. Do the 4 fields of the struct still make sense? In
typescript it becomes 5, but uses indices, which don't work in rust.
