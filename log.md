The clox scanner uses pointer into the char array, which can be substracted form
one another to track progress. The tslox one canot accss the pointers, so it
uses indices instead. Rlox has utf8 strings, however, so we cannot decently to
either: a character counter is needed to get correct column numbers, but only
for correct column numbers!

Good reminder: string[..3] is three bytes, not three characters. So... shit?
`self.as_bytes()[usize]` `byte.is_utf8_char_boundary`
~ it is not all terrible.

One more idea: tokenize the bytes, since this is good enough for lox anyway.

Learning rust while regurgitating crafting interpreters.

### the scanner

Some ideas: probabaly best to use the iterator over the chars to create an
iterator of tokens. Do the 4 fields of the struct still make sense? In
typescript it becomes 5, but uses indices, which don't work in rust.
